#### 1 - Linear Search

- Simplest method for searching.
- This method can be performed on a sorted or an unsorted list.
- When data is unsorted, a linear search algorithm is preferred.
- Time complexity: O(N)

#### 2 - Binary Search

- List need to be sorted.
- Repeatedly divide the list into parts and check for the element.
- Time Complexity: O(log n)

#### 3 - Jump Search

- List need to be sorted.
- The main idea is to search fewer elements compared to linerar search.This is done by skipping some fixed num of array elements in each iteration.
- optimal jump size is √n.
- Time Complexity: O(√n)
- This is faster than linear search and slower then binary search.
